# jsPsych Assignment 2

## Assignment instructions

The goal of this assignment is to familiarize you with the basics of setting up experiments in jsPsych. 

There are multiple steps to this assignment.  

1. Create a new folder for this assignment called "JsPsych_2_assignment". 
     
     * Hint: Create this folder inside your local clone of the Github repository so the changes are tracked by git.

2. Complete the [Hello World tutorial](https://www.jspsych.org/7.0/tutorials/hello-world/#option-2-download-and-host-jspsych). Use 'Option 2: Download and host jsPsych' and follow the same directory structure as shown in the example.

     * Note that in the class, we completed this tutorial with Option 1. 

3. Complete the [Reaction Time tutorial](https://www.jspsych.org/7.0/tutorials/rt-task/). Please use the downloaded JsPsych library (`MyExperiment/jspsych/`) from previous step to import jspsych scripts instead of using the CDN method. 

     * If you are struggling with this tutorial, or you just want some additional reinforcement of the concepts you are learning, [watch this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18NW6jmc6m4). Towards the very end of the video the speaker also shows how to import JsPsych scripts from the local machine.

4. Create a copy of the reaction time tutorial and name the file `myNewExperiment.html`

5. Make sure that both your experiment html files and the related assets (images) are inside the `MyExperiment/` folder (created in step 2), which should also contain your downloaded JsPsych library inside `jspsych/`.

6. Make the following changes to the new experiment (myNewExperiment.html):
   
    * Make the diameter of the orange circle half of its current diameter. 
    
    * Change the blue circle to a blue square.

    * At the end of the experiment, add feedback regarding how fast participants' reaction times were for the blue squares vs. orange circles. 

7. Add a `README.md` file to this folder so that we can understand anything critical to making your code run.

8. Push all changes to your GitHub repository.

## Assessment
This assignment is worth 10% of your grade. The breakdown of grading for this assignment is as follows:

* Completeness (all necessary files submitted in one folder; code accomplishes what it should): 30%

* Reproducability (all files can be executed without error): 40%

* Documentation (code and README.md have been appropriately commented so that others can understand): 30%



**IMPORTANT:** Generative AI (e.g., chatGPT) should not be used to complete this assignment.
