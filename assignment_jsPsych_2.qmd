# jsPsych Assignment 2
The goal of this assignment is to familiarize you with the basics of setting up experiments in jsPsych. 

There are multiple steps to this assignment.  

1. Complete the [Hello World tutorial](https://www.jspsych.org/7.0/tutorials/hello-world/#option-2-download-and-host-jspsych). Use 'Option 2: Download and host jsPsych.' Follow the same directory structure as shown in the example.
2. Complete the [Reaction Time tutorial](https://www.jspsych.org/7.0/tutorials/rt-task/). If you are struggling with this tutorial, or you just want some additional reinforcement of the concepts you are learning, [watch this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18NW6jmc6m4). Disregard the very end of the video when the speaker tries to load packages from the local machine. Please use the downloaded JsPsych library (`MyExperiment/jspsych/`) from previous step to import jspsych scripts instead of using the CDN method.
3. Create a copy of the reaction time tutorial and name the file `myNewExperiment.html`
4. Make the following changes to the experiment:
   
    * Make the diameter of the orange circle half of its current diameter. 
    
    * Change the blue circle to a blue square.

    * At the end of the experiment, add feedback regarding how fast participants' reaction times were for the blue squares vs. orange circles. 

6. Put both the experiment html files and the related assets (images) inside the `MyExperiment/` folder (created in step 1), which should also contain your downloaded JsPsych library inside `jspsych/`.
7. Be sure to add a `README.md` file to this folder so that we can understand anything critical to making your code run.
8. Also link the experiment to you main `README.md` file in the root directory (outside `MyExperiment/`) using a relative link, like `MyExperiment/myNewExperiment.html`. 
8. Push all changes to your individual GitHub repository.

## Assessment
This assignment is worth 10% of your grade. The breakdown of grading for this assignment is as follows:

* Completeness (all necessary files submitted in one folder; code accomplishes what it should): 30%

* Reproducability (all files can be executed without error): 40%

* Documentation (code and README.md have been appropriately commented so that others can understand): 30%



**IMPORTANT:** Generative AI (e.g., chatGPT) should not be used to complete this assignment.
