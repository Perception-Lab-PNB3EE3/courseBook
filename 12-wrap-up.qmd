# Wrap-up

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You've made it to the final week of the course! I hope you are proud of your efforts and all you've accomplished throughout this term! You engaged in industry-standard best practices in open research, from experiment pre-registration to programming an experiment, to analyzing data. You also got to explore a research topic of your own choosing! You might, for example, want to take the pre-registration from this course and use it to guide an independent or thesis project next semester or academic year. 

This week you get to show off all you've learned about your topic and your experiment and data analysis plan through your [final poster presentation](assignment_poster.qmd). We all look forward to seeing them!
