# Open data

This week we will get into the weeds about data. [Danica Evering](https://rdm.mcmaster.ca/about) from [McMaster's Research Data Management Services](https://rdm.mcmaster.ca/) will join us for a lively discussion and in-class exercise using one of McMaster's recently developed data exploration tools. 

**Our goals are to:**

- understand what is meant by open data, as well as potential barriers to publishing open data

- discuss best practices in data management

- explore the wealth of datasets freely available online
