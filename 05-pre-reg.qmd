# Pre-registration

Everything we've discussed so far in the course should have prepared you for this week: Pre-registration. Pre-registration is the act of publishing an experimental design, data collection, and analysis plan, before conducting an experiment. 

After reading week, you will turn in the Pre-registration assignment. This week we prepare you with everything you will need to complete that assignment! You still have a few weeks to refine your experimental design and interests. Be sure you are simultaneously researching your topic of interest and working on this pre-registration between now and the submission deadline. 

**Our goals are to:**

- understand what pre-registration is and when and why to do it

- discuss what goes into a pre-registration

- begin developing a pre-registration for your own experiment 


Slides from this week are available here: [NOTE: Will be updated as course progresses]

**Before next class**

Please begin the [pre-registration assignment (linked here).](assignment_preregistration.qmd)

> NOTE: this assignment will require substantial effort - do not put it off until the last minute! 

[Read Experimentology Ch. 11](https://experimentology.io/011-prereg.html) (it will help you with the assignment!)

Importantly, please continue refining your research topic.
