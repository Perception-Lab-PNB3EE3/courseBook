This is a hands-on, skills-based course to expose you to the “real world” of research related to human perception. Throughout the course, you will research your own topic of interest (using primary scientific literature), design an experiment to test a hypothesis, pre-register your experiment in an industry-standard way, program (using computer code) your experiment, pilot test and simulate data for your experiment, and analyze data from your experiment (using computer code). Prior programming experience is not required but you must have a strong willingness to dive in and learn! We are here to help!\nThe course does not provide a thorough background on what Perception is. You already received that in your second year required coursework. Here, we are more focussed on research skills.",

Don’t worry, you don’t need to know what GitHub is yet! We will discuss it in class on day one. The reason we use GitHub, as opposed to Avenue, is because, many researchers around the world use GitHub every day in their scientific workflows, whereas Avenue is a tool somewhat specific to your undergraduate education. We feel that familiarizing you with GitHub early-on will benefit you as you look for research opportunities or even industry jobs in the future.\nThe course outline is here. It contains an overview of all assessment criteria and relevant institutional policies. A more detailed weekly schedule, with deadlines for each assignment is available here.\nEvery week in class, there will be a lecture component and a hands-on component. You are expected to come to class prepared for discussions about the assigned readings and with assignments completed. Often, we will go over assignments together and discuss any points of confusion. Attendance and participation in class is important.\nThe website you are currently viewing is a Quarto book containing all materials for the couse. The book consists of markdown and executable code. A first draft was created for Winter Semester 2025. It is a work in progress and under continual development alongside iterations of the course.\nUse the navigation bar at the left to view course contents by week (number) and topic.

Please follow the steps below before coming to the first class or tutorial.\n\nDownload an integrated development environment (IDE) for working with code. If you already have a preferred IDE, feel free to keep using that one! If this is your first time encountering the idea of an IDE, some nice options are:\n\n\nVisual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/\nR Studio: https://posit.co/downloads/\n\n\nUsing your terminal or console, make sure git is installed on your machine: https://github.com/git-guides/install-git\nSign up for a GitHub Education account using your McMaster email address: https://github.com/education\n\n\nNOTE: The application process for Github Education takes a few days, so please sign up as soon as you can. GitHub Education gives you lots of nice (free) perks and learning tools!\n\n\nDepending on the IDE you have chosen and your comfort with the command line, you may not want to use any other tools (e.g., many IDEs have built-in integration for git and GitHub). If all of this sounds super confusing, you can use GitHub desktop OR Github CLI to streamline the process of pushing changes from your local machine to the GitHub cloud.\nOn your computer:\n\n\ncreate a new directory (folder) in your Downloads/ location (or any other location that is not synced with an online cloud storage like iCloud or OneDrive). Name the new folder as ‘PNB3EE3’\nwithin this folder, create another folder called ‘Lastname_Firstname_assignments’ – in my case, the folder would be called ‘Fink_Lauren_assignments’\nwithin this folder create a file called ‘environmentAssignment.html’\nopen this file in the IDE you downloaded earlier (in step 1)\nin the environmentAssignment.html file, add the following lines:\n\n        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n        &lt;html&gt;\n        &lt;body&gt;\n\n        &lt;h1&gt;My First Heading&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;My first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/body&gt;\n        &lt;/html&gt;\n\nNow, replace “My First heading” with “What I learned today”.\nNext, replace “My first paragraph” with a few things you learned by completing this tutorial.\n\n\nBe sure to come to the first class with all of the above completed. During the first class, we will discuss all of these concepts further and show you how / where to submit this first exercise. If you’ve run into issues throughout this process, don’t worry, we will help you troubleshoot any issues!",

It is my understanding that your PNB coursework already involves R. I also know there is a Python for PNB course some of you may have taken. If you find yourself needing a refresher on either of these languages, there are so many great online resources! Here is a resource on R essentials and here is one on python essentials.\nI highly recommend doing all of your coding in R markdown, Quarto, or a jupyter notebook. Such notebooks allow you to combine natural language with code. Why would you want to do that? Well, imagine you need to communicate your findings to someone else, or you want someone else to be able to reproduce the exact analyses you did. By writing code, creating detailed descriptions, and plotting figures in line, everything you need to do can all be in one place! In research jargon, we sometimes refer to this as a “reproducible workflow” – if you’re interested in learning about such workflows, here is a primer. Note that there are many types of notebooks to choose from, for example, Jupyter Notebooks, Google Collab Notebooks, and R Notebooks. Choose whichever one you are familiar with or which seems most intuitive to you!\nUnder no circumstances should you alter the raw data file. If you need the data table in a different format, read in the provided file and manipulate the dataframe within your programming environment. DO NOT create new raw data files that need to be read in.\nTry to be efficient with your code. If you find yourself copying and pasting the same chunk of code and changing one variable name each time, there is likely a much better way to do things. Here are some issues to look out for and some ways to mitigate them.",

Some of these tools are GUI-based (GUI stands for graphical user interface), meaning that the user (you, the researcher!) only needs to point and click and drag things around. However, such tools hide what’s going on “behind the scenes.”\nFor the sake of this course, and your own development as a researcher, it is important to understand how code works. Why? Well, you need to understand the limitations of your methods and you need to be able to communicate with others. For example, even if you never write code again after this course, you might have a human programmer or even chatGPT write code for you–how do you know what to ask for? You at least need to be able to describe and discuss how code works and understand how to use code to accomplish tasks.\nSome people in your class may have more programming experience than others - that is great! You can all learn from each other! Coding is a social process. I encourage all of you to work together, to learn from each other, and review each others’ work. If you need more convincing that coding is social, read this. And if you want to explore that linked book further, you will find some great recommendations for writing good research code (though note that the book is mostly focussed on Python).\nFor this assignment, your experiment code should:",

    "text": "What to do\nPNB 3EE3; Fink\nIn the age of Open Science and Reproducability, it is becoming fairly standard practice that analysis code is submitted alongside papers for publication. The idea is that the papers’ claims rely on the analysis code and others should be able to reproduce the results exactly. With this goal in mind, the code you write to analyse the data from your experiment should be well-documented and reproducible.\nFor the sake of this course, the easiest way to accomplish the goal of creating understandable, reproducible code is to use the ‘notebook’ format, which allows you to intersperse chunks of code with chunks of text (markdown). There are many notebooks to choose from: Jupyter Notebooks, Google Collab Notebooks, R Notebooks, etc. You are free to use whichever tool is most comfortable for you.\nBelow are some examples of final analysis repositories from my own research: * https://github.com/lkfink/Kentler_MIM_Behavior * https://github.com/lkfink/pupilTutorial * https://github.com/lkfink/Dundun2_labels * https://github.com/janatalab/GEM-Experiments-POC * https://github.com/lkfink/CMQ\nNone of these are perfect (I am still learning too!); they are here to provide some examples/inspiration.\nYour analysis code should follow your pre-registered data analysis plan. Be sure to write the code for all the analyses you proposed, including any exploratory analyses (as registered or now desired). Also be sure to include visualizations. In addition to visualizing your main findings, you might also want to produce visuals to ensure your data meet certain assumptions or that your experimental conditions were balanced as intended.\nYou should organize your analysis notebook logically, providing heading and descriptive text, notes, and comments where necessary. Someone unfamiliar with your analysis plan should be able to look at your notebook and understand what is going on and what it means.\nYou will run your analysis code on data we will simulate together in class for your experiment.",
