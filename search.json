    "text": "Welcome\nWelcome to Prof. Dr. Lauren Fink’s Perception Lab (PNB3EE3) course in the Dept. of Psychology, Neuroscience & Behaviour at McMaster University. This is a hands-on, skills-based course to expose you to the “real world” of research related to human perception. Throughout the course, you will research your own topic of interest (using primary scientific literature), design an experiment to test a hypothesis, pre-register your experiment in an industry-standard way, program (using computer code) your experiment, pilot test and simulate data for your experiment, and analyze data from your experiment (using computer code). Prior programming experience is not required but you must have a strong willingness to dive in and learn! We are here to help!\nThe course does not provide a thorough background on what Perception is. You already received that in your second year required coursework. Here, we are more focussed on research skills."

Don’t worry, you don’t need to know what GitHub is yet! We will discuss it in class on day one. The reason we use GitHub, as opposed to Avenue, is because, many researchers around the world use GitHub every day in their scientific workflows, whereas Avenue is a tool somewhat specific to your undergraduate education. We feel that familiarizing you with GitHub early-on will benefit you as you look for research opportunities or even industry jobs in the future.\nThe course outline is here. It contains an overview of all assessment criteria and relevant institutional policies. A more detailed weekly schedule, with deadlines for each assignment is available here.\nEvery week in class, there will be a lecture component and a hands-on component. You are expected to come to class prepared for discussions about the assigned readings and with assignments completed. Often, we will go over assignments together and discuss any points of confusion. Attendance and participation in class is important.\nThe website you are currently viewing is a Quarto book containing all materials for the couse. The book consists of markdown and executable code. A first draft was created for Winter Semester 2025. It is a work in progress and under continual development alongside iterations of the course.\nUse the navigation bar at the left to view course contents by week (number) and topic. While most contents are nested within week, the most important documents (like the course outline) have their own pages."

Please follow the steps below before coming to the first class or tutorial.\n\nDownload an integrated development environment (IDE) for working with code. If you already have a preferred IDE, feel free to keep using that one! If this is your first time encountering the idea of an IDE, some nice options are:\n\n\nVisual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/\nR Studio: https://posit.co/downloads/\n\n\nUsing your terminal or console, make sure git is installed on your machine: https://github.com/git-guides/install-git\nSign up for a GitHub Education account using your McMaster email address: https://github.com/education\n\n\nNOTE: The application process for Github Education takes a few days, so please sign up as soon as you can. GitHub Education gives you lots of nice (free) perks and learning tools!\n\n\nDepending on the IDE you have chosen and your comfort with the command line, you may not want to use any other tools (e.g., many IDEs have built-in integration for git and GitHub). If all of this sounds super confusing, you can use GitHub desktop OR Github CLI to streamline the process of pushing changes from your local machine to the GitHub cloud.\nOn your computer:\n\n\ncreate a new directory (folder) in your Downloads/ location (or any other location that is not synced with an online cloud storage like iCloud or OneDrive). Name the new folder as ‘PNB3EE3’\nwithin this folder, create another folder called ‘Lastname_Firstname_assignments’ – in my case, the folder would be called ‘Fink_Lauren_assignments’\nwithin this folder create a file called ‘environmentAssignment.html’\nopen this file in the IDE you downloaded earlier (in step 1)\nin the environmentAssignment.html file, add the following lines:\n\n        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n        &lt;html&gt;\n        &lt;body&gt;\n\n        &lt;h1&gt;My First Heading&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;My first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n        &lt;/body&gt;\n        &lt;/html&gt;\n\nNow, replace “My First heading” with “What I learned today”.\nNext, replace “My first paragraph” with a few things you learned by completing this tutorial.\n\n\nBe sure to come to the first class with all of the above completed. During the first class, we will discuss all of these concepts further and show you how / where to submit this first exercise. If you’ve run into issues throughout this process, don’t worry, we will help you troubleshoot any issues!"

It is my understanding that your PNB coursework already involves R. I also know there is a Python for PNB course some of you may have taken. If you find yourself needing a refresher on either of these languages, there are so many great online resources! Here is a resource on R essentials and here is one on python essentials.\nI highly recommend doing all of your coding in R markdown, Quarto, or a jupyter notebook. Such notebooks allow you to combine natural language with code. Why would you want to do that? Well, imagine you need to communicate your findings to someone else, or you want someone else to be able to reproduce the exact analyses you did. By writing code, creating detailed descriptions, and plotting figures in line, everything you need to do can all be in one place! In research jargon, we sometimes refer to this as a “reproducible workflow” – if you’re interested in learning about such workflows, here is a primer. Note that there are many types of notebooks to choose from, for example, Jupyter Notebooks, Google Collab Notebooks, and R Notebooks. Choose whichever one you are familiar with or which seems most intuitive to you!\nUnder no circumstances should you alter the raw data file. If you need the data table in a different format, read in the provided file and manipulate the dataframe within your programming environment. DO NOT create new raw data files that need to be read in.\nTry to be efficient with your code. If you find yourself copying and pasting the same chunk of code and changing one variable name each time, there is likely a much better way to do things. Here are some issues to look out for and some ways to mitigate them."

It is due before the next class!\n\nNOTE: this assignment will require substantial effort - do not put it off until the last minute!\n\nIf you are struggling with this assignment, go back to the previous data visualization assignment, as well as materials from the statistics courses you have already taken for your degree. Don’t be afriad to ask your peers or instructors for help!\nContinue preparing for your final poster presentation. Be sure to come to the next class with a draft of your poster. It’s ok if the analysis section isn’t done yet, but most other aspects can be completed by now."

If you have gotten really into coding in R and reproducible workflows throughout this course, you could use posterdown; this blog post will give you a quick intro. Or, if you are really sick of code and dealing with unfamiliar tools, you can use powerpoint to make your poster. McMaster library provides free powerpoint poster templates; note that you will need to be logged in via VPN and macid. You are also welcome to explore other online resources and find something that suites your own aesthetic preferences, or to develop your own poster from scratch. Just be sure that the visual design is intuitive, fonts and font sizes are readable, etc. The software you use does not factor into your grade for this assignment. Just be sure your visual design, content, and spoken presentation meet the assessment criteria in the provided rubric."
