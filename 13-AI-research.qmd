# AI in the Research Cycle

This week we will discuss and experiment with ways AI may or may not be reshaping research practices

**Our goals are to:**

- engage critically with AI hype

- understand the ecosystem of available AI tools

- discuss risks AI poses to the scientific ecosystem

- interact with AI in the context of our own research interests
